# Latent Space Exploration with StyleGAN V3
Inspired by [this blogpost](https://amarsaini.github.io/Epoching-Blog/jupyter/2020/08/10/Latent-Space-Exploration-with-StyleGAN2.html). Colab does not have Tensorflow 1 support anymore, and since StyleGAN V3 is built on PyTorch, this code is a PyTorch V3 implementation of the blog post

## Code
- `styleganv3 linear interpolation.ipynb` goes through the entire process step by step, would recommend to go through this first
- `interpolate.py` acts a module file for direct integration into any project, initial requirements + setup would be similar to that in the notebook.
